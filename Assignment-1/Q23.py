"""Question
Find whether the given number is perfect number or not.
Any number can be perfect number in Python, if the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself is equal to that number.

For example, 6 is a perfect number in Python because 6 is divisible by 1, 2, 3 and 6. 
So, the sum of these values are: 1+2+3 = 6 (Remember, we have to exclude the number itself. 
That’s why we haven’t added 6 here). Some of the perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, 8128 and 33550336 so on.
Expected Input:
28
Expected Output:
Perfect number
